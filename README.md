# PRODIGY-DS-05

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project aims to identify accident hotspots and contributing factors, providing valuable insights that can be used to improve road safety and reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.

**DATASET**

The dataset used for this analysis includes various attributes related to traffic accidents, such as:

- Time and day of the accident
- Age and sex of the driver
- Educational level and driving experience of the driver
- Vehicle type and its service year
- Road surface and weather conditions
- Type of collision and number of casualties

**REQUIREMENTS**

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

**VISUALISATIONS**

- Accidents by Hour of the Day
- Accidents by Road Surface Conditions
- Accidents by Weather Conditions
- Accidents by Type of Collision
- Accidents by Types of Junction

**RESULTS**

The analysis script (accidents.py) performs the following tasks:

- Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- Analyzes the distribution of accidents by hour of the day.
- Examines the distribution of accidents based on road surface conditions.
- Investigates the distribution of accidents by weather conditions.
- Analyzes the types of collisions and the types of junctions where accidents occur.
- Creates visualizations to represent the findings.
